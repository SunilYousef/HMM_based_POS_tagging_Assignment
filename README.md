# HMM_based_POS_tagging_Assignment

- Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
- Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class  lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. Note that to implement these techniques, you can either write separate functions and call them from the main Viterbi algorithm, or modify the Viterbi algorithm, or both.
- Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
- List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
